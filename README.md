# Fresh out of nothing.
Such a lovely thing to run when macOS just has been reinstalled.<br>

## Let's start right away
Copy, open terminal and hit enter. Kick back and relax and wait it out.<br>
```shell
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metobie/fresh/master/install.sh | bash
```
## Let's continue
When you get told to open iTerm2, please do so. Don't forget to close your current open termninal session. Run this to continue.
```shell
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metobie/fresh/master/continue_install.sh | bash
```
